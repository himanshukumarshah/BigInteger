# BigInteger

## Features:
1. Supports addition, subtraction, and multiplication of Big integers.
2. Supports integers up to 1024 digits (or more if MAX_SIZE is increased).
3. Handles both positive and negative numbers.
4. Overflow detection.
5. Edge case handling.

## Input Format:
Numbers are taken as strings and stored as digit arrays.

Negative numbers should be entered with - at the beginning (e.g., -123456).

## Limitations:
Only supports integer arithmetic (no decimals/fractions).

Maximum digit count is capped by the MAX_SIZE macro (default: 309).
